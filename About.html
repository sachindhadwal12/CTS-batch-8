  <p>
    With a new session, a new beginning and things will change. When
    Jawaharlal Nehru addressed the nation for the first time, little did we
    know that in a short span of about 70 years, our country will move forward
    to become one of the fastest growing economies and the most promising
    countries of the world. History is testimony to the fact that John F.
    Kennedy believed in new beginnings. His conviction that man had to tread
    the space for gaining knowledge of the far and beyond, at a time when
    space travel was unthought-of. With the turn of the calendar, the
    commitment to take the school to greater heights is more firmly
    established. New energies, new blood pumped into the system brings a fresh
    thought and a paradigm shift is being envisaged. Undoubtedly, this would
    require hard work, perseverance and a firm belief in the adage ‘Yes, We
    Can’, but we are committed and with a firm resolve, would surge forth to
    accomplish the vision of our preceding stalwarts who set the tone and
    tempo for performance. Any institution works smoothly and attains
    recognition and its place on the ladder with team-work and mutual trust.
    The parent body is an integral part of this trajectory. Their continued
    involvement, collaboration and motivation to the student community will
    lead to the accomplishment of personal as well as school goals. Newer and
    more innovative ways of collaboration need to be evolved and implemented.
    To attain this, the institution is committed. To the students, I have but
    one message to give. Dream big and work towards your goal. We, at Delhi
    Public School, R.K. Puram, strive to see your beginnings culminate in
    unparalleled success. And, success comes to those who are good human
    beings while at the same time excel in scholastic as well as co-scholastic
    fields. You stepped into the portals of this great institution with fresh
    thoughts, lofty aims, high hopes, and exalted aspirations. I assure you
    that your ambitions will be accomplished through the able guidance of the
    highly accomplished and experienced faculty of teachers. In return, the
    school seeks superior ethics, positive attitude, social and moral values
    and discipline. Remember, you are the torchbearers and your first and
    foremost duty is to follow the footsteps of the trailblazer alumni yet
    chart a unique course for yourself. To conclude, I would like to reiterate
    my belief with this quote by Henry Ford: If everyone is moving forward
    together, then success takes care of itself. So let’s all join hands to
    take off on this journey to higher orbits of excellence. With best wishes
    to all Padma Srinivasan (Principal) Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram
    Sector-12, New Delhi
